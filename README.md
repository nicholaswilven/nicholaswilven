Hello World! My name is Anthony.
A mathematics undergraduate student who loves math theory and failed to get into computer science major last year.
Currently, I'm aiming to be a Data Science or AI/ML Engineer. I have great interest in Natural Language Processing (and it's weird but fun implementation).
My favourite (and only) programming language is Python yayyy.
Sometimes, I like to solve competitive programming problems in codeforces (You can find me at https://codeforces.com/profile/Carnivorei)
I have done some mini-projects but it's not something worth of bragging for :))
One more time, I really love math theory! Frequently, I left all the boring computation to my code hihihi
You can discuss about math with me, although I'm still noob ahahahaha
